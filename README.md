## Segregation

In many common systems, the particles to be mixed have different properties and tend to exhibit segregation. Particles with the same physical property then collect together in one part of the mixture. Even if particles are originally mixed by some means, they will tend to unmix on handling (moving, pouring, conveying, processing). Here are two examples â€“ pouring into a heap and rolling in a drum. Also included in this section is a demonstration of the Brazil Nut Effect.
